# LRM
A sample of linear regression model.

So a few thing to note,
once you run the code, it will ask you to give it an alpha value, its just the accuracy rate and the lower what you give is, the more acurate it will be.

next, inside the code, there is something called Dataset, its a list that is made out of other lists. every list inside this dataset should hava an x(input) and y(output) value. and the ai will make gusses
based on the dataset. remember, you need to have both x and y for the dataset.

last but not least, there is prediction, you will enter the x value and run the program, it will give you an approximate y, which is called yhat.
